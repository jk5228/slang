# Slang

Slang (stupid language) is a stupid Python-interpreted, dynamically-typed, imperative programming language, featuring first-class functions.

Slang was a short summer project that I embarked on in 2016 after graduating from college and burning out from working on a photography project earlier that summer. I was impatient to start my career working on "real software" and used this project as a way to address that impatience.

The language has a few serious oustanding bugs and usabiilty issues. It doesn't have any features that differentiate it from the sea of existing dynamically-typed, imperative-cum-functional languages. Because I decided to write my own lexer generator and parser generator instead of using some off-the-shelf ones, the language is probably a lot slower and quirkier than it could've been. In short, slang isâ€”well, kind of stupid. But it was a fun summer project that (re)taught me a lot about programming languages, compilers, persistence, and the joy of programming. Also, writing a parser generator is a slog.
